Missing icons in the style of [](http://getbootstrap.com/components/ "Bootstrap") 
and [](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome"). 
Complete with build system based on [](http://fontcustom.com/ "Font Custom") .

This project provides vector images (SVG) and a build system to create css ready icons sets from it.

Mainly we provide icons which we feel missing in Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

To use this project to build icon sets, you need to have font custom installed on you system.
